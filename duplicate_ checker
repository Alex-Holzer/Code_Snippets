Certainly, I'll improve the code by converting it into a function. This will make it more reusable and easier to integrate into larger projects.



```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql import Window
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

def find_duplicates(df, subset=None):
    """
    Find duplicate rows in a PySpark DataFrame.
    
    Args:
    df (pyspark.sql.DataFrame): The input DataFrame.
    subset (list, optional): List of columns to consider for identifying duplicates.
                             If None, all columns are considered. Default is None.
    
    Returns:
    pyspark.sql.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing only the duplicate rows.
    """
    # If subset is not provided, use all columns
    if subset is None:
        subset = df.columns
    
    # Define a window specification that partitions by the specified columns
    window_spec = Window.partitionBy(subset)
    
    # Add a count column using the window function
    df_with_count = df.withColumn("count", F.count("*").over(window_spec))
    
    # Filter the rows where the count is greater than 1
    duplicates = df_with_count.filter(F.col("count") > 1).drop("count")
    
    return duplicates

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a SparkSession
    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("FindDuplicates").getOrCreate()
    
    # Create a sample DataFrame
    data = [
        (1, "A", 100),
        (2, "B", 200),
        (1, "A", 100),  # Duplicate
        (3, "C", 300),
        (2, "B", 200),  # Duplicate
        (4, "D", 400)
    ]
    df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["id", "name", "value"])
    
    # Find duplicates considering all columns
    all_duplicates = find_duplicates(df)
    print("Duplicates based on all columns:")
    all_duplicates.show()
    
    # Find duplicates considering only 'id' and 'name' columns
    partial_duplicates = find_duplicates(df, subset=['id', 'name'])
    print("Duplicates based on 'id' and 'name' columns:")
    partial_duplicates.show()
    
    # Stop the SparkSession
    spark.stop()
```

This improved version offers several advantages:

1. **Reusability**: The code is now encapsulated in a function `find_duplicates()`, which can be easily imported and used in other scripts or notebooks.

2. **Flexibility**: The function accepts an optional `subset` parameter, allowing you to specify which columns to consider when identifying duplicates. If no subset is provided, it defaults to using all columns.

3. **Clarity**: The function includes a docstring that explains its purpose, parameters, and return value, making it easier for others (or yourself in the future) to understand and use the function.

4. **Example Usage**: The script includes an example of how to use the function, demonstrating both full and partial column matching for duplicates.

5. **Proper SparkSession Management**: The example code creates a SparkSession at the beginning and stops it at the end, which is a good practice for resource management.

To use this function in your own code, you would typically import it from a module where it's defined, then call it with your DataFrame:

```python
from your_module import find_duplicates

# Assuming 'df' is your existing DataFrame
duplicates = find_duplicates(df)
duplicates.show()

# Or, to find duplicates based on specific columns:
duplicates = find_duplicates(df, subset=['column1', 'column2'])
duplicates.show()
```

This approach makes your code more modular and easier to maintain. Would you like me to explain any part of this improved code in more detail?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
