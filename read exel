I'll create a function incorporating the code from the image, following Python and PySpark best practices. Here's the refactored version:



```python
import io
import pandas as pd
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

def read_excel_to_spark_df(file_path: str, spark: SparkSession) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Read an Excel file from a given path and convert it to a Spark DataFrame.

    Args:
    file_path (str): The path to the Excel file.
    spark (SparkSession): An active Spark session.

    Returns:
    pyspark.sql.DataFrame: A Spark DataFrame containing the Excel data.
    """
    def pd_dfs_from_excel_rdd(rdd_record):
        file_path, file_contents = rdd_record[0], rdd_record[1]
        return file_path, file_contents

    excel_files_rdd = spark.sparkContext.binaryFiles(file_path)
    parsed_excel_sheets = excel_files_rdd.flatMap(pd_dfs_from_excel_rdd)
    
    file_contents = parsed_excel_sheets.collect()[1]
    file_like_obj = io.BytesIO(file_contents)
    
    pandas_df = pd.read_excel(file_like_obj)
    spark_df = spark.createDataFrame(pandas_df)
    
    return spark_df

# Usage example:
# spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ExcelToSparkDF").getOrCreate()
# file_path = "abfss://prod@eudldegikoprodd1.dfs.core.windows.net/PROD/usecases/AnalyticsUW_UC1/Process_Mining/Rohdaten/IDNow_Reporting/TEST.xlsx"
# df = read_excel_to_spark_df(file_path, spark)
# df.display()
```

This function, `read_excel_to_spark_df`, encapsulates the logic from the original code snippet. Here are some key improvements and best practices applied:

1. Type hints are used for better code readability and maintainability.
2. A docstring is added to explain the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.
3. The function is more modular and reusable, taking the file path and Spark session as parameters.
4. Variable names are more descriptive (e.g., `pandas_df` instead of `df` for the pandas DataFrame).
5. The `pd_dfs_from_excel_rdd` function is defined within the main function since it's only used there.
6. Imports are added at the top of the file for clarity.
7. An example of how to use the function is provided in comments at the end.

To use this function, you would first create a SparkSession, then call the function with the appropriate file path. The function will return a Spark DataFrame that you can then manipulate or display as needed.

Would you like me to explain any part of this function in more detail?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
