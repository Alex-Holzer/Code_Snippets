### Optimized Prompt for Code-Only Output with Pylint Compliance

**Objective:** Generate **clean**, **reusable** Python and PySpark code that maximizes efficiency, maintainability, and adheres to industry best practices. The code should be optimized for large-scale data processing in distributed computing environments. Ensure the code fulfills **pylint** guidelines to achieve a **perfect score**. Do not include any explanations or additional text—only the code.

#### Code Generation Guidelines:
1. **Efficiency and Reusability**  
    - Design the code to be modular and reusable across different projects.  
    - Use algorithms and data structures that minimize computational complexity and execution time. Ensure they are appropriate for PySpark’s distributed architecture.  
    - Apply PySpark-specific optimizations such as broadcast variables, partitioning strategies, and caching mechanisms.

2. **Style Guide Adherence and Pylint Compliance**  
    - Ensure strict PEP8 adherence for readability, consistency, and maintainability.  
    - Follow **pylint** guidelines to ensure the code achieves a **perfect score** (e.g., appropriate variable naming, proper indentation, limited line length).  
    - Implement PySpark best practices, such as minimizing data shuffles, selecting optimal transformations, and leveraging built-in functions.

3. **Type Annotations and Refactoring**  
    - Include comprehensive type hints in all function and method definitions to clarify input and output types.  
    - Refactor complex or inefficient code segments into simpler, more readable, and maintainable formats without altering functionality.

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**  
    - Use the **numpydoc** style for all docstrings, detailing the purpose of each function or class, parameters (including types and expected values), return values, and any exceptions raised.  
    - Ensure docstrings and inline comments explain non-obvious code segments.

5. **Seamless Code Integration**  
    - Ensure code builds on previous snippets without unnecessary repetition and maintains continuity for easy integration into larger systems.  
    - The code should preserve context to ensure smooth enhancement or feature addition.

6. **Practical Example**  
    - Provide real-world code examples, especially focusing on large-scale data processing tasks using PySpark.

#### Example Problem:  
Develop a PySpark application to process and analyze large-scale user activity logs to identify peak usage times.

#### Requirements:  
- Optimize for distributed processing.  
- Ensure minimal data shuffling.  
- Follow PEP8 and PySpark best practices.  
- Ensure the code is clean and reusable, achieving a **perfect score in pylint**.

#### Expected Output:  
- Refactored PySpark code with comprehensive type hints and docstrings.  
- Adherence to **pylint** guidelines for a **perfect score**.  
- No explanations or additional text—only code.
