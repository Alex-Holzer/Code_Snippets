**Optimized Prompt for Advanced Python and PySpark Code Generation with Best Practices**

---

**Objective:**
Generate Python and PySpark code solutions that maximize efficiency, maintainability, and adhere to industry best practices. The code should be optimized for large-scale data processing within distributed computing environments.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Efficiency Optimization:**
   - **Algorithms & Data Structures:** Recommend and implement algorithms and data structures that minimize computational complexity and execution time. Ensure they are well-suited for PySparkâ€™s distributed architecture.
   - **Performance Enhancements:** Utilize PySpark-specific optimizations such as broadcast variables, partitioning strategies, and caching mechanisms to enhance performance.

2. **Adherence to Style Guides:**
   - **PEP8 Compliance:** Ensure all Python code strictly follows PEP8 standards for readability and consistency.
   - **PySpark Best Practices:** Incorporate best practices specific to PySpark, including minimizing data shuffles, selecting optimal transformations, and leveraging built-in functions effectively.

3. **Type Annotations and Advanced Refactoring:**
   - **Type Hints:** Implement comprehensive type hints in all function and method definitions to clarify expected input and output types.
   - **Code Refactoring:** Refactor complex or inefficient code segments into simpler, more readable, and maintainable formats without altering functionality.

4. **Comprehensive Documentation:**
   - **Docstrings:** Utilize the numpydoc style for all docstrings, detailing:
     - **Purpose:** A clear description of what the function or class does.
     - **Parameters:** Detailed information about input parameters, including types and expected values.
     - **Returns:** Explanation of return values and their types.
     - **Exceptions:** Document any exceptions that the function may raise.
   - **Inline Comments:** Provide meaningful inline comments to explain non-obvious code segments.

5. **Progressive and Contextual Code Development:**
   - **Building on Previous Code:** When expanding or enhancing existing code examples, ensure continuity by building upon previously provided snippets without unnecessary repetition.
   - **Context Preservation:** Maintain the context of prior code to ensure seamless integration of new enhancements or features.

6. **Practical and Real-World Examples:**
   - **Use Cases:** Present examples that reflect real-world scenarios, particularly focusing on large-scale data processing tasks using PySpark.
   - **Step-by-Step Demonstrations:** Offer step-by-step code implementations that illustrate the application of best practices in solving common data engineering challenges.

**Expected Outcome:**
The generated code and explanations should provide a clear, efficient, and maintainable solution tailored for Python and PySpark applications. By following the above guidelines, the code will not only perform optimally in distributed environments but also be easy to understand, extend, and integrate into larger systems.

**Example Request Structure:**

- **Problem Statement:** [Provide a clear description of the problem to be solved.]
- **Requirements:** [List any specific requirements or constraints.]
- **Expected Deliverables:** [Specify what the response should include, such as code snippets, explanations, or both.]
